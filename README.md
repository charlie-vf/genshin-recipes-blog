# Genshin Food Blog

[Deployed Site](https://genshin-recipes-blog.herokuapp.com/)

*In this ReadMe, I use Genshin Impact, and the abbreviated Genshin, interchangeably*

## **Introduction**

This Food Blog was created for my fifth project in Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Course.
It is aimed at players of HoYoLab's Genshin Impact, providing a place to share recipes inspired by those we can craft in game. 
<p>
However, it is largely a Japanese/Chinese inspired food blog which is suitable for anybody who is looking for inspiration in these areas.

## UX
